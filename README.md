Vehicle detection and counting are very important in traffic monitoring, toll collection, military applications, etc. The technology of vehicle detection in the captured video has an implementation in a variety of fields. In this project, we implemented a basic model of Vehicle detection and counting. The video clip is taken as input, many frames are extracted and the background is estimated along with shadows.Several algorithms are used for subtracting the background on input video materials. The data obtained during the analysis of the algorithms are compared The most efficient algorithms that coped with the task most quickly, accurately, and with the least expenditure of resources, were identified, as well as those that coped with the task the worst.
